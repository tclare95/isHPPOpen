This is the rewritten implementation of ishppopen.co.uk
This Next.js site shows water levels, events and status for HPP.

The site provides a quick way to check if the Holme Pierrepont whitewater course is open. Water level data, events and status updates are stored in MongoDB and served through Next.js API routes. React Bootstrap components power the UI and SWR hooks fetch data in real time. An admin section lets authorised users manage events and messages.
